Description: Fit growth models to otoliths and/or tagging data, using the 'RTMB'
  package and maximum likelihood. The otoliths (or similar measurements of age)
  provide direct observed coordinates of age and length. The tagging data
  provide information about the observed length at release and length at
  recapture at a later time, where the age at release is unknown and estimated
  as a vector of parameters. The growth models provided by this package can be
  fitted to otoliths only, tagging data only, or a combination of the two.
  Growth variability can be modelled as constant or increasing with length.
